    <h1>CS-I Journal J1006: Source Control</h1>
    <p>Name: Razeen Rahman</p>
    <p>Date: 22-Aug-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mr. Ben-Yakoov</p>
    <p>I assisted: Christopher Wang</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What is Git communicating to you?</h3>
    <p>I believe that Git is communicating who wrote the log, and when the log was written.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>I see that they both list the helpful comment I added.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: Why do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>So I know why I committed the file in the first place. This will be a helpful note for me to look back at in case I forget the reason I commited.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>Under git status, they are displayed in red. I also notice that it says file1.txt has been modified while file2.txt is untracked.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>They are not displayed in the same section. This is because file1.txt was being tracked, so it is under the changes not staged for commit. However, file2.txt is a completely new file which had not been previously tracked, so it is under the untracked files section.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>In the git status, they are both displayed in green. They are both under the section "changes to be commited."</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>file1.txt is listed as modified while file2.txt is listed as a new file. However, both are under the same section and both are in green text.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p>1 file was listed as being changed. File1.txt was the one listed as being changed because it was modified.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>The specific differences for each file are in blue under the git diff --cached command. The specific differences for each file is what is written within them and what action they underwent.</p>

    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>It tells me that nothing has changed since the commit because nothing was changed since then.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to use a source control system to add, delete, and move documents. I also learned how to commit changes and view previous versions. The big idea of this lesson was to learn to use a source control system.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>The main challenge I encountered is what each command does, and how the source control system itself worked. It was very confusing to me and I had to reread it multiple times to understand.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think it could be made more clear, and it could also use more step-by-step instructions because at times I felt very lost.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>It has opened up many new possibilites for me with the shell because now I can trial and error with less worry of something going wrong. This is because I can return to a previous version and view the changes I made.</p>
