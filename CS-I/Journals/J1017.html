    <h1>CS-I Journal J1017: Binary Adders</h1>
    <p>Name: Razeen Rahman</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
    <p>The C out truth table produces the output column for the number you would carry in binary addition.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
    <p>The S truth table produces the output column for the number that represents the sum of the binary addition.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
    <p>The C in digit is 0 while the C in digit for the last 4 rows is 1.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Why is this true?</h3>
    <p>This is true because the table counts up in standard order of binary.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
    <p>This is because in the least significant bit position, there is no carry present which must be added. The carry is only present later in the chain of adders.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>S would not be available instantly because all things in the real world have some sort of delay whether it be a very short amount of time. This can be proved by the fact that it takes a couple of seconds for light (the fastes thing in the universe) to travel between the Earth and the Moon.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C(base15) is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
    <p>We can infer the two numbers (A and B) have been added together many times, leading to a greater number each time they are added. This state is called exponential growth.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to construct and interpret binary adders.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered a challenge during section 3.3 as I did know understand what it mean by the state it is commonly called. The Falstad excercise was also quite challenging as I did not really know where and how to start at the beginning.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think the experience could be improved by adding some more examples and practice in preperation for the Falstad excercise.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that binary adders are a crucial component performed by computers, so it is important I fully understand it for future success in technology fields.</p>
