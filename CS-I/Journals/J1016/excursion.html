  <h2>Seven Segment LED Digits</h2>
  <p> Visual represenatation of the 16 digits which will be displayed by the 7 segment LED.</p>

  <h2>Four-Bit Binary Input Representation</h2>
  <p>Assume the 4 inputs are labelled as b3, b2, b1, and b0. The outputs represent the digit which will be displayed on the 7 Segment LED, and each singular segment which must light up to create that digit.</p>

  <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
<p>The canonical representation above represents the four inputs, and each of the seven outputs which must be determined as true or false for the certain digit to be displayed. For example, for the digit 5 to be shown, the input would be 0100, and the output would be 0110011 to make the certain segments which must light up to form a 5 be true. In the case of the 5, the segment a, d, and e will be false and not light up, while the rest of the segments will be true and light up, generating the digit 5 on the chip. Each of these segments with their output label can be seen below to visualize this concept.

<p>I do want to note that I was unable to create a comprehensive Falstad circuit of this though due to my incompetence and a major problem I had. My main problem was that I was unable to add in logic gates with more than 3 inputs on the site which are most likely required for something as complex as this due to the sheer amount of inputs and outputs. However, even if I did know how to add these in, I do not know how gates such as a OR or an AND gate function with more than 2 inputs as I have only learned how to get the outputs from them with 2 inputs. Therefore, this would have led me to confuusion about which gates I would have used for which situation.</p>
<br>
<p>With this said, I do understand the end goal of what was supposed to happen with this activity, and I hope I am able to recieve assitance on what I can do to fix the problems I encountered and eventually create a logic gate sequence for a 7 segment LED.</p>
