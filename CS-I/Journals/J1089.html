    <h1>CS-I Journal J1089: Hello World</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why do you think Hello world is typically the first program taught to students?</h3>
    <p>The Hello World program is typically the first program taught to students because it is a simple input/ouput command that will allow students to become comfortable with programming languages. It is a easy and hands-on approach for beginners to see how programming languages will run their code.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: How might the Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it's written in?</h3>
    <p>It may be different in syntax as each programming language has its own, unique structure. For example, in Python to print a statement you just need to use the print() command, but in Java to print a statement a lot of scaffolding is required along with the command System.out.println(). </p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that there are many different programming languages, and that each has it's own syntax and structure. I also learned that the Hello World program is the first activity beginners will do in programming.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I did not encounter any challenges in this activity.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by explaining the difference in a compiling language and a interpreted language.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that programming has to be very accurate and precise due to the structure and syntax of programming languages. Otherwise, the compiler will be unable to run code I write.</p>
