    <h1>CS-I Journal J1013: Boolean Algebra</h1>
    <p>Name: Razeen Rahman</p>
    <p>Date: 12-Sep-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mr. Ben-Yakoov</p>
    <p>I assisted: No One</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction â‰¢?</h3>
    <p>This is a symbol for exclusive disjunction because if both the output and input are true, the entire statement is false as they cannot "equal" each other. However, if the input is true and the output is false, the entire statement is true or vice versa. This symbol can be though of it saying that if both are equal, or true to each other, then the statement is false.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h3>
    <p>The formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table only relates to the number of inputs because inputs determine the amount of outputs, therefore also determining the number of rows which must exist. The formula is 2^n because for each input there is 2 different possibilities of what it could be (0 or 1), and the n represents the number of inputs which are are present in the truth table. The formula is exponential as more combinations of true/false occur as more inputs are added.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to read Boolean truth tables, Boolean operations, Canonical representations, and De Morgan's Laws. These will help me later in coding with true/false statements.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when learning the truth tables because I did not understand why the formula 2^n was exponential. I later learned that it was exponential because as more inputs were added, there were more possible combinations of true/false that increased exponentially rather than linearly.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by adding more examples because a lot of the information on the wiki was very obscure and hard to understand. I think more practice examples could back up the information found in the journal because learning is easier hands-on.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that Boolean algebra is used to denote values as true or false and that I will need to start spending more time on computer science. This is because we are getting into harder topics that will take much more practice and studying in the class. I also realize that Boolean algebra will be a crucial component to the entire class, so I should learn it to my best ability.</p>
