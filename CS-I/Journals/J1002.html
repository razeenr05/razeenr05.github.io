    <h1>CS-I Journal J1002: Shell</h1>
    <p>Name: Razeen Rahman</p>
    <p>Date: 18-Aug-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mr. Ben-Yakoov</p>
    <p>I assisted: Christopher Wang</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model</h3>
    <p>Google and Gmail are two services which implement the client/server model because both have clients whom access their servers.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I believe the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important because both users may require a common directory that servers the same purpose, such as the one I have made to put my Journals in (other people within computer science have this same directory).</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3> Question 1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>I think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it because it is the root of all other personal files and directories. The special symbol makes it easy to identify and easy to access.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p>Yes, the prompt changed. It changed by adding /Merlin after the tilde (indiciating we are in a different directory). This is useful because it shows the current directory you are working in, and it gives you a better sense of navigation throughout the shell.</P>

    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens each time you press the ↑?</h3>
    <p>Pressing the up key goes to previously used commands.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What happens each time you press the ↓?</h3>
    <p>Pressing the down key cycles back to more recently used commands.</p>

    <h2>Section 6</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>No, it was not. It did not print onto the screen because it echoed into a new file called out.txt. I think the text is now within the file out.txt and is visible through the cat command.

      <h2>Section 7</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>The ls command differs from the tree command in format. The tree command shows everything (all files and directories) in a hierarchical and visual format while the ls command only displays the directories or files under the current directory.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>You would use ls when you only want to check what is under your current directory, and you would use tree when you want to check your entire Shell's organization.</p>

    <h2>Section 8</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>I think the argument in the sleep command specifies seconds of time.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
    <p>I am able to prove my hypothesis by setting a timer (or counting the seconds in my head), and I am also able to cross check by increasing the time and seeing if the break is longer.</p>

    <h2>Section 9</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
    <p>Rather than taking the ability to run commands away, it allows me to continue running commands.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>Running a job in the background most likely means to run a job without affecting what is going on in the foreground.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>The number displayed in the brackets is the number of jobs being run, or what number the job is.</p>

    <h2>Section 10</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
    <p>I notice that there are multiple jobs running at the same time and it lists them by order of when started.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>I explain my observations by using the jobs command over and over, and adding new jobs to see if it changes. I can see that the jobs slowly start to dissapear as it is completed as well.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to navigate through the Tabby shell, and learn how to use the Tabby shell's commands. I think the big idea is how each little part within the shell is connected together to allow access into an operating system.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>A challenge I encountered while going through W1002 was how a few of the commands/jobs worked, such as the "sleep" command.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think it could be improved through less wordiness because I had trouble grasping a few definitions and topics because it was very lengthy.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>What I have learned from W1002 has affected my thinking to become more hands on. I saw that being interactive with the wiki as I went through it allowed me to better grasp and learn the commands, purposes, and definitions given throughout. Because of this, I can now naviagte through the Tabby shell and use it for it's many functions.</p>
