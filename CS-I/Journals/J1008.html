    <h1>CS-I Journal J1008: Merlin Mission Manager</h1>
    <p>Name: Razeen Rahman</p>
    <p>Date: 24-Aug-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mr. Ben-Yakoov</p>
    <p>I assisted: No One</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: If you're outside of the Merlin directory and attempt a  Merlin Mission Manager  command, what is printed for your "Current location"?</h3>
    <p>It says I am Outside of Merlin.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: If you're inside of the Merlin directory and attempt a  Merlin Mission Manager  command, what is printed for your "Current location"?</h3>
    <p>It prints my current root as the Merlin root.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Based on the output of the above command, what information does the  Merlin Mission Manager  provide to you?</h3>
    <p>It provides me with what missions I have available, whether they are accepted, when they are due, and when it expires.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Look at the directory listing before and after you issued the "merlin prepare" command. What's changed?</h3>
    <p>Before running the merlin prepare command, there were no directories for the missions. After running the merlin prepare command, two directories were created for the missions.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What do you think the purpose of the "prepare" command is?</h3>
    <p>I think the purpose is to create a directory in which the mission will be completed.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What changed in this directory after you issued the prepare command?</h3>
    <p>It created 4 .txt files for this section of the mission (1 challenge of the mission), and 2 .sh files.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What is the purpose of the prepare command and how does its role differ depending on context?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this prepare command was to create files for this section of the mission, and it differs depending on context because it creates different files/directories based on what directory you are in for the mission.</p>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how the Merlin Mission Manager works, and how I can complete missions. The big idea of this wiki was to help the reader understand the Merlin Mission Manager.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I had to create a Merlin directory because I did not realize I needed a directory called Merlin for missions to show up. This is most likely because I read too fast.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think it could be improved by adding more information about grading policies of the missions.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that my lab grades in skyward come from Merlin Missions. This means I should spend time getting comfortable with the Mission Manager, and that I should complete all my Missions on time for a good grade in this class.</p>
