    <h1>CS-I Journal J1012: Alternative Base Addition</h1>
    <p>Name: Razeen Rahman</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: No One</p>
    <p>I assisted: No One</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>In addition, you must first align the digits vertically. Then you add the right-most column, and if it is greater than the base, you carry over whatever is excess to the next column. You then add up the addends and carry number in the next column on the left, and if there is any extra numbers that surpass the base you carry it over to the next column. You repeat this process until you have finished your entire problem, making sure there are no extra carry numbers at the end.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>You need to remember that the octal numbers only have 8 digits rather than 10 digits like the decimal system due to a different base. This means the digits cut off at 7 as there is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. This alters how you carry over your numbers and how you add them together. For instance 7+4 in Octal is 13.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>You need to consider that there are 16 different digits in the hexadecimal system rather than 10 digits like the decimal system due to a different base. However, after it repeats it goes to 10 or 20 rather than continuing on after 16, or E. This alters how you add up two numbers because for instance 7+9 is 10.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>In binary, you need to consider that there are only 2 different digits rather than 10 digits like the deicmal system due to a differnt base. You must also realize that 1+1=10, so the sum of a column would end up being 0 and you carry a 1 to the next column because of this. With this said, 1+1+1=11, so if this happens your sum for the column is 1 but you also carry a 1 to the column on the left.</p>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to add numbers in the hexadecimal, binary, and octal systems. The big idea of this wiki was to explain how the different bases effect how numbers are added in each of these systems.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I was learning the hexadecimal addition because I was confused how something worth 16 (E) could then lead into the number 10, so I had to make my viewpoint on the matter different. Rather than think of 10 and ten, I started thinking of it as 1-0, or 1*16^1+0*16^0=16.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by adding more simple practice problems so the larger and more complex questions are somewhat easier to understand.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that there are many different number systems in computer science, and it is important to know how to convert between them and add them because they are all neccesary in code. It also changed my thinking because rather than thinking of 10 as the only base, I now also see 2, 8, and 16 as number bases.</p>
