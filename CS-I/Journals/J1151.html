    <h1>CS-I Journal J1151: Conditional and Flow Chart</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h3>
    <p>By allowing for more possibilities/paths going into the end point through the use of a boolean.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true?</h3>
    <p>This is because a true boolean is the direct/expected result, or the consequent.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</h3>
    <p>The first jump is conditional because it is comparing the numbers 5 and 4 to see which is greater than the other. Whether the jump is executed or not is dependent on if the original number (5 in this case) is greater than 4 or not.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the jump instruction after the consequent is to skip the alternative section and get to the afterAlternative section of the code. </p>
    <h3>Question 3: Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?</h3>
    <p>No jump instruction is required after the alternative because it will flow into the afterAlternative section without a jump, and it will not randomly go back into the consequent section. Put simply, the code will run as intended without a jump instruction.</p>

    <h2>Flow Charts XML File</h2>

    <p>Simply put this XML file into Draw.io to view my flowcharts for this journal.</p>
      
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that conditionals create multiple paths in codes to create more possibilties in which the path can take to the end point of the program.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I had to interpret the assembly language and make the flowcharts for this journal. However, careful reading and thinking allowed me to overcome them.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by more clearly explaining traffic laws for the flowchart section, and explaining how specific it wants the flow chart to be.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that conditionals are a vital part to coding, and they can allow for much more complex programs rather than just a program that goes in one single path every single time.</p>
