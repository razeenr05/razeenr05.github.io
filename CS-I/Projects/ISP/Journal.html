    <h3>(Software) Development Engineer</h3>
    <p>Software/Development Engineers are people who develop and design computer software and applications. They are more commonly known as a "coder" in today's world, and they are cruicial in our day-to-day lives. Think about the apps one uses on their mobile device; those are created and constantly kept up to date by software engineers. To be a software/development enginner, qualities such as mathematical expertise and problem-solving skills are required, but most importantly, knowledge in programming languages (such as Python, Java, Swift, etc.) is required in order to create the code itself. I believe this role would be suitable for me because I am well-versed in mathermatics and I am able to troubleshoot problems I encounter which would allow me to efficiently debug code as I write it. A challenge I would expect to encounter in this role is a lack of knowledge in a programming language, however, this can easily be avoided with proper practice and learning through means such as CoderMerlin wikis and continuing my ProjectStem courses. </p>
    <h3>QA Engineer</h3>
    <p>QA Engineers are the people who test, identify issues, and fix code before it is released, or submitted in our case. Depending on whether the QA Engineer plans on fixing the code themselves or not, they may not have to be as sufficent in programming languages as a software engineer, however, it would be in their favor to have knowledge in such languages to effectively debug and test it. However, the role surely requires the ability to pay attention to little details, patience, problem solving skills, and communication skills to relay information to the software/development engineers. I believe I could take on this role if need be because I would be able to dedicate the time to identify small errors within te code and fix them. A challenge I may face in this role however is communication because I would have to work highly in conjunction with the software/development engineer and I do not have experience in coding with another person. This challenge could easily be minimized through getting to know your own team mates and learning to work in conjuction with them on the same task. </p>
    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <p>Project Managers simply put are the leader/guide of the group. They are responsible for planning, over seeing, and helping the team reach the end goal. This could be done through means such as creating a schedule for others in the group, setting deadlines for certain portions of the project to be completed, and by keeping all team members on task. Project Managers are also required to try and solve issues that arise throughout the creation process whether it be an argument or an obstacle found while creating the project. I believe I am not very fit for this role as I do not see myself being the leader of the entire team. I am not able to take lead very well due to my introvertness. However, I believe I could easily improve on this social skill with time, and once I do this role could be fit for me because planning is a strong suit I hold.  </p>
    <h3>Product Manager</h3>
    <p>Product Managers must be able to identify what will make their project sucessful whether it be through pitching new ideas or identifying what will sell their product to consumers. Product managers must have good critical thinking skills to ensure that the choices made by the group are effective and neccesary for the overall end goal's success. Furthermore, product managers must also have social skills to sway consumers why their product is superior to other competitors or why their product is revolutionary/useful. I believe I would not be fit for this role because I am not a very creative person meaning I would be unable to come up with new ideas that benefit the ISP. Furthermore, as stated earlier I lack in social skill meaning I would also be unfit in trying to advertise the product. Though there is not really a good way to overcome these obstacles, if I did have to take on this role I could try my best to come up with ideas for the product through research, and I would have to give it my all in advertising the product if it is something like a presentation. </p>
    <h3>Release Engineer</h3>
    <p> Release Engineers focus on the configuration of and delivery of the software being produced. Their role is to state the steps needed to release the finished software by ensuring the code is effectively stored in the code respository, checking the compilation of the code, testing the code for its output, and packaging the final product. Release engineers are important to the team because they set how the final product will be distributed to consumers. They have to make sure the final product is consumer appealing in collaboration with the product manager, and make sure the software is bug-free, user friendly, and ready to use. Personally, I think I could take on this role as the only real quality this role needs is problem solving, and this role already recieves a lot of support from all the other ones. This role quite simply just wraps up the project for it to reach its end goal so it is nothing extremely difficult to do. Some challenges that one could face in this role however are bugs and errors in the code that went unchecked. To overcome any final issues such as this, the release engineer could either just recieve aid from other team mates or debug the code by themselves until the problem is identified and solved. </p>
