    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Razeen Rahman, and I am currently a junior at Allen High School. I am in Mr. Ben-Yakoov's second period class, and I am enrolled in Computer Science I.</p>
    <p>Some hobbies of mine are playing video games, listening to music, and playing basketball. I am also a hard worker who has big dreams. I put school first to make sure I am successful for the future.</p>
    <p>I was born in Frisco, Texas, and ever since then I have lived in Allen. I've attended Allen ISD for my entire life, and I don't plan on changing that. However, after I graduate I plan on attending either UT or UTD.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to having a great year!</p>

    <h2>Why a Digital Portfolio?</h2>
    <p>There are multitudes of benefits that come with creating a Digital Portfolio.
    <p>First, and most obvious, is its easy access and superb organization. All of one's projects can be stored right in the Digital Portfolio, making it a great way to display a person's talents, accomplishments, and creations. A digital portfolio can even be used to get jobs because many employers like seeing one's knowledge all in one place.</p>
    <p> A second, and maybe more obscure, benefit is the ability to track one's growth overtime. With a Digital Portfolio, a person can easily look back at their past work and compare it to their new ones. This can lead to a greater understanding of where you have already improved, and where you can still improve in the future.</p>
